# Heart Attack Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project was developed for the **AI in Medicine** course at **Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering**. Our goal was to **predict heart attack occurrences** in patients by analyzing clinical data and using machine learning algorithms. This is essential as timely intervention can significantly reduce heart muscle damage and improve patient outcomes.

## Team
**Team 5**  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Enas Yassine

## Motivation
Heart attacks are among the leading causes of death globally. **Early prediction and prevention** are critical in reducing mortality. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to predict heart attack risks based on clinical features, providing healthcare providers with a tool for **early diagnosis**.

## Methodology

### Data Source
- **Dataset:** Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset from Kaggle.

### Preprocessing
- Handling **missing values**.
- **Outlier removal**.
- **Normalization** of data.

### Features
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Cholesterol
- Blood pressure
- Other relevant indicators

### Algorithms Used
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**

### Best Performing Model
The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy of **86%**.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision and Recall:** Evaluate the modelâ€™s ability to correctly identify positive cases.
- **AUC (Area Under the Curve):** Assesses model performance across all classification thresholds.
